# AnyWear

Our group aims to bridge the gap between hardware, software, and wearables. The convenience and portability of wearables allows for seamless integration between a person and their hardware. For this hackathon, our implementation is focused on controlling a longboard. This requires a wearable to communicate with a mobile app, which then communicates to an Intel Edison connected to the longboard's motor. We believe the applications of such interconnectivity between an individual and their hardware presents immense potential.
